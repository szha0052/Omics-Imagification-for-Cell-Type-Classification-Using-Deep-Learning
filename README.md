Omics Imagification for Cell-Type Classification Using Deep Learning
This project explores the concept of "omics imagification," a novel approach to transforming high-dimensional molecular data into two-dimensional images. The goal is to improve the classification of different biological phenotypes by leveraging computer vision techniques and deep learning models.
In this project, students will develop a method to convert a numerical vector of single-cell sequencing measurements into structured RGB images, ensuring that each transformed image maintains a one-to-one correspondence with its original biological sample. This transformation process aims to:
• Represent molecular abundance and gene intensity in a spatially coherent 2D format.
• Preserve interrelationships between molecular features to enhance phenotype classification.
• Enable the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated cell-type identification.
A key challenge in imagification is ensuring that the spatial arrangement of pixels within the generated images accurately reflects biological patterns. Students will work on designing and implementing a transformation pipeline that maintains meaningful molecular relationships while minimizing information loss.
